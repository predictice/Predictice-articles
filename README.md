## **It all starts with the OKR framework !**
  
At Predictice we build a SaaS platform that delivers real time analytics for lawyers to save time in their research and boost performance and customer satisfaction.
  
Since the first year of Predictice, we have used the OKR goal setting framework to drive us ( click here to know more about OKRs).
  
We do quarterly reviews of the performance and objectives for each team in the company (Product, Tech, Marketing, Sales and G&A‚Ä¶).

In March 2021 the technical team decided to set up the following OKRs for the 2nd quarter of 2021 :
  
üöÄObjective : Foster sharing and upskilling
  
üéØKey Results :
- 1 event per month among tutorials / coding competitions / innovation days / hackathons
- 10% of tickets are paired-reviewed

  
The OKR remained almost the same during the following quarter: one event per month but 20% of peer-reviewed tickets.
  
The second KR metric became value-based, because it is computed on the team‚Äôs overall effort (points done during a sprint). This stimulates you to cope first with tasks with more complex work underneath.
  
Why did we decide to set these objectives?
  
Our main goal was to gather the tech team together and to skill-up on various subjects (not only on pure technical issues, but also on ideas to improve our organization).
  
On the one hand, these events give us the opportunity to experiment with new technologies, either to solve internal operational problems, or to improve or even start new features.. On the other hand, these meetings allow us to capitalize on existing knowledge, so that developing habits and tips become lingua franca.
  
We also realized that having these events was a great idea for team building.
  
## **How do tutorials work ?**

  
Our tutorials usually take half a day. First, one or two members present the subject to the rest of the team.
  
Then, hands-on sessions follow in which the team members try to put into practice what they have just learned.
  
Subjects can come from anyone, but they have to be compliant with some needs: they should potentially interest the entire team, they should pair with a hands-on session that can be accomplished during the tutorial.
  
Sometimes this requires narrowing down big subjects into more digestible topics. For example ‚ÄúMerging and rebasing with git‚Äù instead of an entire git overview.
  
  
## **What are the rules for the coding competition ?**
  
We usually choose 2 exercises(on leetcode.com), one considered easier than the other.
  
The idea is to spend around 1 hour on the easier one, to get in the mood and practice a bit. Then we go with more or less 2 hours on the tough one. The exercises are chosen by senior programmers to maximize the learning potential (dynamic programming, matrix use cases, etc.).
  
We can do these coding exercises in small groups or alone. We always have an active meet call to share our wins or failures.
  
Then we spend 1 hour with everyone, sharing our difficulties and thinking process on each exercise. This is even more interesting because we have different developer profiles in our team, each one with their own language preferences and their own strategies to approach a problem.
  
leetcode.com also provides a way to compare performances for every solution we come up with, so it‚Äôs a bit of a healthy competition among developers and programming languages to figure out who will come up with the best idea.
  
  
## **An innovation day for a tech start-up, really ?**
  
We invest one day in a complete sprint to explore technical solutions that we don‚Äôt currently use in our stack to test it and to decide if it is applicable to answer to our final developer experience.
  
For instance, our first innovation day was dedicated to testing another technology for our administration back-office.
  
During a preparation meeting the entire team proposes as many subjects as they want on a jamboard and decide what will be the topics of the innovation dayüëá

Ideally we set up a team for each subject to avoid being alone for one day!

  
## **Merge requests peer reviewed**
  
We also increased the amount of work coded or reviewed in pairs. We realized that having two people review a merge request, not only makes the review better but also allows us to share the methodology we use to review. Plus we can learn even more by doing a useful and in-depth review than we would by only coding.
  
This is not for every review but that‚Äôs why we decided to set an OKR with this 20% of points peer reviewed/coded.
  
Peer reviewing also helps colleagues to keep in contact with each other, even when working from home. You‚Äôre not only talking to the 2 or 3 people you work directly with, but also with anyone who is willing to review with you!
